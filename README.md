# WoolieInvadersCPlusPlus
 'WoolieInvaders' is a simple top-down game created by me and Travis McPhee back in 2015 for a school assignment.
 You play as a Coles employee defending your store against waves of Woolworths employees by shooting big red hands at them.
 This is a C++ recreation of that game using SDL3. The original version was created using Python 3 and the pygame module.

## Why?
 I hadn't used C++ for a while and wanted a refresher, so to refamiliarise myself with the language, I chose to remake this game as the scope and requirements are already well defined. 
 I've kept it quite faithful to the original, using mostly the original sprites and even the stolen/copyrighted music and sound effects!.

This version has been changed to run at a 16:9 aspect ratio (the original is in 4:3), so some of the sprites, like the menu backgrounds and ingame UI have been adjusted to work in 16:9 (currently, it ONLY works well in 16:9. Any other aspect ratio and things will be off-centre).
You can toggle fullscreen by pressing 'F11'

I may update the game with better visuals and remove the copyrighted audio, but I wanted to complete a faithful recreation first.
